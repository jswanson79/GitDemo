This is Sergio Castillo. I'm currently finishing up the last few classes of my Associate's degree at WCC. I'm an IT Administrator at a small software company in Ann Arbor and after finishing my degree I will be looking to change careers as a Software Developer. Hope to meet each and every of you in class!
