Hey, I'm Timbre, I'm a programming student and I hope to get into Data Sciences. I'm a husband and father to 2 cats, Kovu and BlackJack. I love computers, I started building and playing with them with my dad in the mid 90s. You think Bash would be easy for me because it's just DOS, but DOS was crap too.
